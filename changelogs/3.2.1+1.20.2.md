# YetAnotherConfigLib 3.2.1 for 1.20.2

## Changes

### Config API

- Added `ConfigClassHandler#save` and `ConfigClassHandler#load` and deprecated `ConfigClassHandler#serializer`.
  - The serializer should now never be called directly.
  - New load method tells serializer to load into a new instance of the config class. Only applied if the load was fully successful.
  - Deprecated `ConfigSerializer#load` for `ConfigSerializer#loadSafely`.
- Added new parameter on `SerialEntry`, called `required`. 
  - If set to true, and the entry is not found in the config, the config will be re-saved with the default value.
  - If set to false, and the entry is not found in the config, the default value will be used, but the config will not be re-saved.
- Added new parameter on `SerialEntry`, called `nullable`.
  - If set to false, and the entry is found in the config, but the value is null, the default value will be used, and the config will be re-saved.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed error when using the same image twice.
- Removed debug log from WEBP and GIF image loaders.
